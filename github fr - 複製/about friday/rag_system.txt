# Friday's RAG System

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a system that allows Friday to access knowledge and provide more accurate, informative responses.

## How RAG Works

1. **Retrieval**: When you ask a question, Friday searches its knowledge base for relevant information.
2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is used to enhance the AI's understanding of your query.
3. **Generation**: The AI generates a response based on both its language model and the retrieved knowledge.

## Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is a collection of text files stored in the `knowledge_base/` directory. Each file contains information that Friday can access.

You can add your own knowledge by:
1. Creating a text file with a `.txt` extension
2. Adding information in plain text format
3. Placing the file in the `knowledge_base/` directory

The system will automatically include this information when generating responses.

## Customizing Knowledge

For best results, organize your knowledge files by topic. For example:
- `history.txt` for historical facts
- `recipes.txt` for cooking information
- `personal.txt` for information about yourself

This organization helps Friday find the most relevant information for your questions.

## Rebuilding the Knowledge Base

If you add new knowledge files, you need to rebuild the knowledge base index using the command:
```
rag rebuild
```

This ensures Friday can access the newly added information.
