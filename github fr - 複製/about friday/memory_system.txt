# Friday's Memory System

Friday uses a sophisticated memory system to remember conversations and important information, making interactions more natural and contextual.

## Memory Types

Friday has two types of memory:

1. **Short-term Memory**
   - Stores recent conversations temporarily
   - Used for immediate context in the current session
   - Saved in `short_term_memory.json`

2. **Long-term Memory**
   - Stores important information persistently
   - Used for remembering critical details across sessions
   - Saved in `long_term_memory.json`

## Memory Prioritization

Not all information is equally important. Friday assigns priority levels to memories:

- **Priority 1 (Low)**: Basic exchanges and routine conversation
- **Priority 2 (Medium)**: Useful information and moderate importance exchanges
- **Priority 3 (High)**: Critical information, preferences, and important exchanges
- **Priority 4 (Permanent)**: Essential information that should never be forgotten

## Memory Consolidation

Periodically, Friday consolidates short-term memories into long-term storage:

1. Short-term memories are evaluated for importance
2. Important memories are transferred to long-term storage
3. Short-term memory is cleared for new conversations

You can manually trigger this process with the `save` command.

## Memory Optimization

As long-term memory grows, Friday automatically optimizes it by:

1. Identifying less important or older memories
2. Removing redundant information
3. Keeping the most relevant and important memories

You can manually optimize memory with the `memory trim` command.

## Privacy Note

All memory is stored locally on your device. No conversation data is sent to external servers beyond what's required for processing individual messages.
